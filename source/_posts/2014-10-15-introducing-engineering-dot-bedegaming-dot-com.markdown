A long time in the hoping, not so long in the making (thanks to [Octopress](octopress.org) and [Justin Kelly's Theme](https://github.com/wallace/justin-kelly-theme)), we're pretty excited to finally be able to show you our new engineering microsite.

We've got some great posts lined up: everything from how we manage our army of servers to our approach to continuous delivery. In the meantime, you can browse some of our open source software using the links on the right.
